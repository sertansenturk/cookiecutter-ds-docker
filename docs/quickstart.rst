Quickstart
==================================================

**Note:** You need to `install Docker <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/>`_ as a prequisite. 

To build and run the Docker stack in a baked project, simply run:

.. code:: bash

    cd /[base_folder]/[repo_slug]
    make

Please refer to the ``{{ cookiecutter.repo_slug}}/README.md`` file for other commands.
