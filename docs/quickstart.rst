Quickstart
==================================================

To build and run the Docker stack in a baked project, simply run:

.. code:: bash

    cd /[base_folder]/[repo_slug]
    make

Once the stack is up and running, you will see a link on the terminal, e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=3c321..., which you can follow to access the Jupyter interface from your browser. You can reach the mlflow UI at http://localhost:5000.

Please refer to the ``{{ cookiecutter.repo_slug}}/README.md`` file for other commands.
