Definition of Done (DOD) defines a list of criteria which must be met before the team considers a ticket is "done".

Below are the criteria of the types of tickets defined in Definition of Ready (namely, [Feature](#feature), [Task](#task), [Bug Fix](#bug-fix), [Spike](#spike), [Epic](#epic)).

### General
* The ticket should be reviewed by at least one person other than the assignee.
* The documentation should be done, if applicable. The documentation may not be a full write-up. It may as well be inline code documentation, or a comment in the ticket.

### Feature
* Code should have _Unit Tests_ and _Integration Tests_, where applicable.

### Task
* The deliverables (scripts, figures etc.) should be attached or linked to the ticket.

### Spike 
* Each question in the Spike should be adequately answered, i.e. the answer should lead to the next action (Task, Feature etc.) unambiguously, or explicitly address anything that is still not well understood. The answer does not need to be written to the ticket; we may simply link to the (written) description of the next ticket.

### Bug Fix
* The bug cannot be reproduced anymore (and the problem is actually fixed). 

### Epic
* All tickets in the Epic are closed.
