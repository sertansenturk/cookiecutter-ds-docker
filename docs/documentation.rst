Documentation
==================================================

We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__ for the documentation. The documentation is hosted online at `Read the Docs <https://cookiecutter-ds-docker.readthedocs.io>`_.

If you would like to build the documentation locally, you need to run:

.. code:: bash

    make sphinx-html

Then, you can then access the documentation by opening ``./docs/_build/html/index.html`` on your browser.
