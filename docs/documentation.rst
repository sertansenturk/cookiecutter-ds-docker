Documentation
==================================================

We use `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_ for the documentation. If you would like to build the documentation locally, you need to run:

.. code:: bash

    make sphinx-html

You can then access the documentation by opening ``./docs/_build/html/index.html`` on your browser.
