``cookiecutter-ds-docker`` is a personalized, Docker-based cookiecutter template repo for Data Science projects. It aims to standardize the common decisions (repo structure, setup, integrations), which I need to take care for each the data science project, and hence minimize the (overtly dull) start-up effort for future work.
