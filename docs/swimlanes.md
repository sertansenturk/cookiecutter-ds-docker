Swimlanes show in which stage a ticket is. They allow us to track how each ticket is progressing, and also give us a sense of the overall progression of the Sprint and the project. 

Swimlanes typically follow the consensus built around [Definition of Ready](definition_of_ready.md) (DOR) and [Definition of Done](definition_of_done.md) (DOD). 

The table below summarizes the swimlanes, and what each ticket has to fulfill to progress to the next lane.

| __Epic__           | All __Epics__ should be in this lane. This lane also gives quick access to filtering tickets by __Epic__. | __Epics__ should reside in this lane upon creation.                       | While there are _Open_ tickets linked to the __Epic__                                                        | Move the ticket directly to __Closed__, if all tickets related to the __Epic__ are _Closed_. Note that __Epics__ related to a recurring theme (e.g. "Management Tickets") may stay here.                                                                 |
| __Backlog__        | Tickets, which are not part within the scope of the current Sprint.                                       | Non-__Epic__ tickets should reside in this lane upon creation.            | While the ticket is not within the scope of the current Sprint.                                              | Move the ticket directly to __Closed__, if the team decided not to work on the ticket (e.g. it is not relevant anymore) in the future.
